								Front-End web developer with 5 years of social media manager
								experience. Combining my technical and social media skills to
								build tech solutions that have a real positive impact on the
								user.üê±‚Äçüíª
								<br />
								<br />
								Being a freelancer taught me to manage my workdays and
								prioritise my tasks to meet deadlines.Being on my own, I had to
								constantly learn and expand my knowledge in many different
								areas: content creation, influencer marketing, problem-solving,
								and client relations.With these skills, I created viral content
								that reached up to 1M views for my clients.
								<br />
								<br />
								The Social media manager role allowed me to travel and learn
								about different countries and cultures which transformed in a
								need of being part of a diverse team - with different
								perspectives and new approaches to create better solutions.My
								passion for learning and problem-solving has led me to
								transition into tech where I am constantly faced with new
								challenges and opportunities to grow my skill set.I am tech
								savvy, love using tech solutions for many day-to-day problems
								and would love to contribute to building such products that make
								people's day-to-day better.
